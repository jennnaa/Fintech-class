- Integrate Beanworks with different accounting software, such as:

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or service would you suggest they offer?
I would like Beanworks to provide more of accounting software, not only Account payable, such as account receivables, since account payable and account receive both have similar concepts. 

In addition, Beanworks can expand their business to provide more cloud platforms or hybrid products. Expend their intended user to big companies or public companies that has more requests. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Explore new areas and hack for new ideas are always two keys to push fintech companies moving forward. It will not only attract more users, but push the Company innovation. 

Provide hybrid product will expand their market for big enterprises, since some of large enterprise might not ready for cloud soluation due to size of their Company or security reason, keep them in desktop but provide more cloud benefits solution would attract those big companies to move to the cloud in the future. In addition also lead the Beanworks to think more solution for those hybrid users. 

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
To implement additional products or service as I recommend above, I would think that Beanworks need to think below few points:
- People, hire or maintain people within the Company，the 21st century is the century of talents;
- Innovation, expend market with new innovation idea, will push the Company to learn new technolgies, adopt or explore more technicals that required for new products, and new market, for them to gain more market shares

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your soluations?
Beanworks already gained some market shares on the current Account payable market, although they keep innovating their current products by either integrate with new tool or enhance existing feature, create new feature frequently. 

With my idea, hopefully will open a new window for them, explore new opportunites.
